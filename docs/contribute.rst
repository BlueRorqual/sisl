.. _contributing:

Contributing
============

The sisl code is open-source, and thus we encourage external users to contribute
back to the code base.

Any size of contribution is extremely welcome and especially bug-reports!


Bug-reports
-----------

Bug-reports should be opened at the development site `here <issue_>`_, then press
"Issue" and select *Bug report*.


Issues
------

If you have problems using sisl, please let us know `here <issue_>`_, then press
"Issue" and select *Issue*.


Feature requests
----------------

Missing features may be requested at the development site `here <issue_>`_, then press
"Issue" and select *Feature request*.


Contribute external code
------------------------

External toolbox codes may be contributed `here <issue_>`_, then press
"Issue" and select *Contribute toolbox*.

There are two cases of external contributions:

1. If the code is directly integratable into sisl it will be merged into the sisl source.

2. If the code is showing how to use sisl to calculate some physical quantity but is not a general
   implementation, it will be placed in toolbox directory.

Either way, any contribution is very welcome.
